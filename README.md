Original Excel document used for personal budgeting over a 10-year period

This repository presents the original version of Album Financiero, the personal finance document I used to track and understand my expenses over more than ten years. 
The anonymized Excel file consolidates all data capture and analysis in a single workbook divided into sheets such as C. Diaria, Presupuesto, Inversiones, Deudas, and Viajes, each covering daily transactions, annual budgets, investments, debts, and travel summaries. 
Despite the lack of normalization rules or automation, this document effectively supported my financial organization before evolving into the Power BIâ€“based capstone project now published in a separate repository. 
A short explanatory video and anonymized file are included here for reference.
